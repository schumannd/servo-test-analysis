\section{Application Survey}


\subsection*{Which development paradigm? Which development
language(s)?}
Rust. Other packages with different langauges.
\subsection*{Requirements? Specification? Documentation? Other artefacts available?}
Servo is an open source project hosted on GitHub. As most of these project do, the core developers have established a certain GitHub workflow \footnote{https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Github-workflow}. It consists of... bla. Every Pull Request needs to pass the contribution checklist \footnote{https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md}\\

Also hosted on github the servo wiki \footnote{https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki} can be found. It documents... bla.

\subsection*{Current testing status, approach? Bug repositories?}
- GitHub's issue tracker \footnote{https://github.com/features} is used to track bugs and link the appropriate PRs fixing them to them.
- Mozilla's mach system is used for testing.(Testing guide\footnote{https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Testing})


- Servo is scheduled in Q4 2015 for alpha release ``that just works'' (mobile, but also other platforms)\footnote{https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap}
\subsection*{What is your current personal involvement in the
application? Developer, tester, user, etc.?}
Aspiring user.
\subsection*{Document these findings in a summary for your project report at the end of the semester}
Done\\

\section{Initial Test Plan}
\subsection{Discuss \& evaluate five V\&V questions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item When do verification and validation start? When are they complete?
  
  V \& V starts with the begining of the project. As with many open source project that are developed by the community, the stakeholder or ``customer'' is the community itself. Which means that developer and customer are often the same person. In the case of servo the software is validated in bi-weekly meetings\footnote{https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meetings} where both short-term next steps and long term milestones are discussed.
  
  Verification is done through an extensive testing system. It is maintained by every developer as every code change needs to be accompanied by a test before it is merged into the code base. This test suite runs on every reviewed pull request, via two build servers (bors-servo\footnote{https://github.com/bors-servo} and buildbot\footnote{http://servo-buildbot.pub.build.mozilla.org/}). This ensures that no new bugs are introduced into the system.
  
V \& V will never be complete. Even after the release there will always be bigfixes or new features that need to be tested as well. One could argue that V \& V ends when the project gets abandoned but you can hardly call that a complete state.
  \item What particular techniques should be applied during development?
  
  The Rust language itself comes with a testing blahblah.
  \item How can we assess the readiness of a product?
  \item How can we control the quality of successive releases?
  \item How can the development process itself be improved?
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Consider different test classifications, discuss \& evaluate these different test approaches w.r.t. your application:}

• Validation vs. Defect Testing

• Development, Release, User Testing

• Unit/Component,Integration,SystemTesting

\subsection{Consider available artefacts, discuss \& evaluate potentials w.r.t. coverage-based testing for your application}

\subsection{Develop \& document initial test plan based on your findings}

\section{Test automation}

\subsection*{Find, experiment and evaluate test tools appropriate for your application}

\subsection*{Important parameters: development language, field of application}

\subsection*{Good overview of open source testing tools: http://www.opensourcetesting.org/}

\subsection*{Most important automation possibilities: Test case execution \& management, Coverage measurement}

\section{Notes}

\subsection*{Trying to get any kind of test coverage}
- GNU tool gcov does not work with rust

- kcov is the only working option right now. Does not work on OS X or Linux/arm.

- We have to run everything on a VM now which slows things down a lot.

- Making gcov work was moved to RFC in January 2015.

\subsection*{Meeting 20.11.2015}
- Status quo: kcov does not work with any servo binaries

- apt-get install kcov yields old binary. We need to install from master.

- kcov still errors. We try a random hint for debian jessie to install it with libbfd-dev

- First coverage created by just starting the servo binary with kcov (and necessary --verify flag)\\

- To do this we moved the servo binary to servo\_orig and placed our own helper script in its place:

\lstset{language=Python}  
\begin{lstlisting}

#!/bin/sh

kcov --verify --exclude-pattern=/.cargo,../src /home/johannes/servo/cov 
 /home/johannes/servo/servo-sync/target/debug/servo_orig "$@"\\

\end{lstlisting}

Open problems:

- Unit tests and integration tests work differently (unit tests use test binaries, wpt tests use servo binary)

- Execution of Several tests in a row does not accumulate the coverages (as it should according to kcov docs)

- Tests don't generate deterministic coverages (e.g. statements covered by 1 test range: 26976 to 27104)

- Getting coverage for 1 test takes about 30 seconds. (WPT contains 3615 tests, whole suite over 6600) => Full coverage report would take 22 days to generate
